The provided text describes a very large codebase.  It's impossible to give an exact count of classes without directly examining the code, but based on the analysis, there are easily **over 100 classes**, potentially many more.  The analysis mentions numerous classes in various parts of the system, including many within the Events Manager core, its various add-ons (like the automation system and multiple bookings), and within external libraries like Chart.js, Dompdf, and Selectize.js.  The count is likely significantly larger than 100 due to classes within the external libraries not fully detailed.
